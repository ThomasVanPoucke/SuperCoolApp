<h2>Run both applications in watch mode</h2>

When making changes it's possible to see the effects of your changes immediately after saving your changes. This is called 'watch mode'.

This is how you host the website in 'watch mode'.

Open a terminal in the project directory and start the ASP.NET Core server

<code>dotnet watch run</code>

Open another terminal and start the Angular application

<code>ng serve --proxy-config proxy.config.json</code>

Open a browser window and navigate to localhost:4200
